# Khmer Letters Game

This small game is designed to teach those who want to learn Khmer letters, such as type designers and language learners. The primary focus of this game is to help users become familiar with Khmer consonants and subconsonants, particularly between Chhor and Moul style variations.

The game was inspired by the [Southeast Asian Font Workshops](https://www.fontpad.co.uk/seafontworkshop2019/) that I conducted with [Ben Mitchell](https://www.fontpad.co.uk). This game is particularly useful for such workshops, both online and offline.

## Lessons

The lessons are mostly the matching game of letterforms and styles. There will be several lessons designed to make the learning more fun.

- Lesson 1: Consonants (Chhor â€“ Moul)
- Lesson 2: Subconsonants (Chhor)
- Upcoming...
